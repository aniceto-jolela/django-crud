                This web-site is available in the <a href="https://github.com/aniceto-jolela/django-crud">Github</a> repository, for those who want to study the code or make a fork of the Project be comfortable.

                It has another <a href="https://django-login-logout.onrender.com">project</a> but simple without image manipulation, simply only authentication and the user record.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every base structure is already done (the business and blog part) if you want to do the fork or clone to reuse the code and redo a new project is comfortable (<a href="https://github.com/aniceto-jolela/Django-login-logout">Github</a>).
            </p>
