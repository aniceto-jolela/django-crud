                Django is a <span class="code-inline">high-level web framework</span> built using Python, designed to facilitate the rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. It was created by Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison in 2003 and released publicly in July 2005. The framework follows the <b>Model-Template-View (MTV)</b> architectural pattern, which promotes the separation of business logic from presentation, making it easier to manage complex applications.

            <h2>Key Features of Django</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt>Rapid Development</dt>
                <dd>Django emphasizes quick development cycles, allowing developers to move from concept to deployment efficiently.</dd>
                <dt>Security</dt>
                <dd>The framework includes built-in protections against common security threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and cross-site request forgery.</dd>
                <dt>Scalability</dt>
                <dd>Django is capable of handling high-traffic sites; many well-known platforms, including Instagram and Mozilla, utilize it for their web applications.</dd>
                <dt>Reusability</dt>
                <dd>It encourages the reuse of components through its modular design, adhering to the <code>&lt;Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)&gt;</code> principle.</dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
                Django also provides an optional administrative interface that allows users to manage application data easily. This interface is dynamically generated based on the models defined in the application, making it a powerful tool for developers

            <h2>Django in Cybersecurity</h2>
            <img src="{{MEDIA_URL}}security.jpg" width="500" />
            <p><br/>
                Django's architecture inherently supports several cybersecurity practices, making it a suitable choice for developing secure web applications. Here are some ways Django contributes to cybersecurity:
            </p>

            <h3>Built-in Security Features</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Authentication System</dt>
                <dd>Django comes with a robust authentication system that handles user accounts, groups, permissions, and cookie-based user sessions.</dd>
                <dt>Cross-Site Request Forgery Protection</dt>
                <dd>It includes middleware that protects against CSRF attacks by requiring a token for form submissions.</dd>
                <dt>SQL Injection Prevention</dt>
                <dd>By using an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) system, Django abstracts database queries, reducing the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities.</dd>
            </dl>
            <h2>Secure Development Practices</h2>
            <p>
                Django promotes secure coding practices through its documentation and community guidelines. Developers are encouraged to follow best practices such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using HTTPS for secure data transmission.</li>
               <li>Regularly updating dependencies to mitigate vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li>Implementing proper input validation and sanitization techniques.</li>
            </ul>
