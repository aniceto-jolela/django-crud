# Django authentication crud

#### For the creation of this website was used:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) as programming language
- [Django Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/) to facilitate the rapid development of safe and easy to maintain sites
- [Foundation](https://get.foundation/index.html) (The most advanced responsive front-end framework in the world) for design

 <p><br/>
    This web-site is not intended to focus on the <code>&lt;front-end&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;design&gt;</code> its main purpose are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>User authentication</li>
    <li>Limit access</li>
    <li>Creating privileges</li>
    <li> Making crud (create, read, updates and delete) of user</li>
    <li>Using good security practices</li>
</ul>

   ðŸ’¡: A file storage tip has been shared, is located in the <a href="#">Management</a> menu.
</p>
<p><br/>
    This web-site is available in the <a href="https://github.com/aniceto-jolela/django-crud">Github</a> repository, for those who want to study the code or make a fork of the Project be comfortable.
</p>
<p><br/>
    It has another <a href="https://django-login-logout.onrender.com">project</a> but simple without image manipulation, simply only authentication and the user record.
</p>
<p>
    Every base structure is already done (the business and blog part) if you want to do the fork or clone to reuse the code and redo a new project is comfortable (<a href="https://github.com/aniceto-jolela/Django-login-logout">Github</a>).
